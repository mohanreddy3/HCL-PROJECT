# HCL-PROJECT
## Overview:
This project, developed by me, focuses on real-time age detection through image processing using Java.When executed, the program activates the webcam, detects faces, outlines them, and 
displays the predicted ages, employing advanced Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) technology.

## Features:
1)Real-time webcam activation and face detection. 

2)Precise age prediction using CNN.

3)Accurate face outlining for visual representation.

4)Suitable for diverse applications: security, retail, demographic analysis, and more.

### Requirements for executing this project:
1)Java Development Kit (JDK):
JDK 8 or higher for Java application development.(Preffered version : JDK 17)

2)Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
Any Java-supported IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code for coding and debugging.(Suggested : VsCode)

3)OpenCV Library:
OpenCV for Java to access computer vision algorithms and image processing functions."https://opencv.org/releases/" (preffered :opencv-4.8.0-windows)

4)Maven Installations: "https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi" (Suggested: apache-maven-3.9.4-bin)

5)Computer Neural Networks is being taken refference from "https://talhassner.github.io/home/publication/2015_CVPR"

### Compiling Project: In order to build this project, run a mvn clean install at the project root.
